# MNIST using Keras Python API with TensorFlow as the backend.
The MNIST ( Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology ) dataset is a dataset containing 60,000 images of hand-written digits from 0-9.
The objective of this project is to create a deep learning model which can identify the hand-written digit from the image.
Artificial Neural Network ( ANN ) created using Keras for the MNIST dataset
