# <div align="center">**Identify Hand Written Digits using Artificial Neural Networks**</div>
The MNIST ( Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology ) dataset contains 60,000 images of hand-written digits from 0-9.
The objective of this project is to create a deep learning model which can identify the hand-written digit from the image.
An Artificial Neural Network ( ANN ) was created using Keras Python API with TensorFlow as the backend to fulfill the objective of this deep learning model.
